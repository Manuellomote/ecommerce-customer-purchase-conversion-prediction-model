# ecommerce-customer-purchase-conversion-prediction-model
A linear regression prediction model on a randomly generated dataset 

This project analyzes synthetic customer behavior data from an random e-commerce platform to explore session-level conversion patterns. It demonstrates a full pipeline from data cleaning and feature engineering to predictive modeling and visualization.

## Project Highlights
- Merged session, interaction, and purchase data into a unified view
- Engineered features like age bins, session duration categories, and interaction counts
- Built a logistic regression model to predict session conversion
- Visualized conversion trends and discussed business implications
- Evaluated the limits of synthetic data and proposed scalable big data tools
  
## Note
This analysis uses randomly generated data. Insights and patterns may vary with each simulation and do not reflect real-world behavior.

## Future Work
- Apply workflow to real customer data
- Explore alternative models and deeper personalization
